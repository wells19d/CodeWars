## Code Wars Workings

#### This was something I figured I should be doing in my down time when I'm not developing on Kitchen Queue and need a break... but should still be coding. I decided to start at the bottom and not jump ahead to get more of the real aspect of a new developer using this site. All in all, this is just for fun and to keep me coding.

### Progress

#### I'll try to keep this updated as much as possible with what I'm working on.
