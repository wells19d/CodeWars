## Code Wars Workings

#### My fellow cohort members starting working on codewars, so I started doing it myself (9-18-25). Much of the code is for starters but I figured I should do some of the newbie stuff and see how well I do compared to them. So far it's been interesting. My goal is to do these daily when i'm not working on my personal private project, Kitchen Queue.
